# CITS3403-project

1. Project description, Explain design and use

Our application is a Macro calculator which allows users to input their details: height, age, weight, gender, activity level and calorie goal. 

They can then view a calculated recommended daily calorie intake which they can share with others to compare results. 

If a user set their calorie goal as a "Deficit" overtime if they ate the recommended calories they will lose weight. As the user's weight changes they can recalculate new results to view comparisons graphed overtime.
