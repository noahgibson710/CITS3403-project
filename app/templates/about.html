  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Our calculator provides precise estimates of your daily macronutrient
    requirements (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) to help you reach your
    fitness goals. Whether you're trying to lose weight, build muscle, or
    maintain a healthy lifestyle, understanding your macros is key.

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    By entering your age, weight, height, activity level, and fitness goals,
    our calculator uses the <strong>Mifflin-St Jeor equation</strong> to determine your
    <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</strong> — the number of calories your body burns at rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:</strong><br>
    For men: <code>BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age + 5</code><br>
    For women: <code>BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age − 161</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    This BMR is then multiplied by your <strong>activity level</strong> to estimate your
    <strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</strong> — the total calories you burn per day.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Activity Multipliers:</strong><br>
    Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2<br>
    Lightly active (1–3 days/week): BMR × 1.375<br>
    Moderately active (3–5 days/week): BMR × 1.55<br>
    Very active (6–7 days/week): BMR × 1.725<br>
    Extra active (physical job + exercise): BMR × 1.9
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on your goal (e.g. fat loss, muscle gain, or maintenance), the TDEE is
    adjusted to create a <strong>calorie deficit</strong>, <strong>surplus</strong>, or <strong>maintenance level</strong>.
