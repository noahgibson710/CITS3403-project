  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Our calculator provides precise estimates of your daily macronutrient
    requirements (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) to help you reach your
    fitness goals. Whether you're trying to lose weight, build muscle, or
    maintain a healthy lifestyle, understanding your macros is key.

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    By entering your age, weight, height, activity level, and fitness goals,
    our calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to determine your
    Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
    From there, it calculates the optimal macronutrient distribution for
    your specific needs.
